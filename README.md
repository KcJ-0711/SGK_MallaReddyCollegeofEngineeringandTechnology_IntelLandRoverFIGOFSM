Intel Industrial Training Land Rover FIGO FSM project from team SGK, CSE-DS MRCET
This project has been created in order to make available the work and experience gained in the process of developing the project.
# Project Description
The Intel Land Rover FIGO FSM is a project developed to design a Finite State Machine that outputs the current room location based on the given input( either 0 or 1).
FIGO FSM is developed to be a Mealy machine which produces an output of the state location on an input of the a binary digit.
The project is developed in verilog.
The project contains a verilog model and a sample testbench to evaluate the model.
The project has been developed using the Intel Quartus Prime (Lite) Edition, the simulation has been performed using ModelSim which comes along with the Intel Quartus Prime (Lite) Edition.
The model has been implemented on physical board (access granted by the Intel Unnati Industrial Training) through LabsLand FPGA Laboratory.
The model has been implemented on Cyclone V (5CSEMA5F31C6).
The Verilog code is just the prototype and some more features shall be added to the model.
# How to Use
Land Rover Figo Fsm can be implemeted on any verilog compiler and can be simulated on any simulator but the Intel Quarts Prime (Lite) is recommended.
# Credits
